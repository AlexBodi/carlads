		 <p>Usually, a new feature on CarLads is made like this:
		       <ul style="margin-left: 7em;">
		       	<li>Meet the owner at some agreed location</li>
		       	<li>Take photos/film the car</li>
		       	<li>The owner will send some sort of text for editing</li>
		       	<li>Edit the video and publish it</li>
		       	<li>Edit the photos</li>
		       	<li>Edit the text</li>
		       	<li>Build the dedicated web-page, add the text, photos and video, publish it</li>
		       </ul></p>

		<p>This time however, we kind of skipped on step. When asked to provide some sort of text, a backstory about this beautifull Honda, the owner of this car surely delivered way more than expected. A full story came over the
		e-mail, so good that it would be a pitty to alter. So here it goes, Becca is telling us about her Civic:</p>

       <p>  I grew up in a small close family mostly made up of men...cousins, uncles and a brother. I was the only girl in my family for a while and, as you can imagine, I was spoilt and was stuck into everything they were doing. My late granddad Michael O'callaghan was a truck driver. My two uncles, Ger and Edward, were also driving lorries for a living and also, one uncle, had a successful past time of rally driving. Travelling the country to attend rally's to support my uncle, Edward, was definitely a big influence in my love for cars. As soon as the engine was on I was in the back seat, ready to go, I didn't care where i was going, I used to love sitting in the truck and just going where the road would take us. My grandfather was the person who influenced me the most with cars, he always had me outside washing the car inside out and upside down,only to his standard though, I think this is where i got the OCD of cleaning the car from!! My other uncle, Ger, always had some sort of car, while I was growing up. Not only rally cars but also road cars, such as twimcams, Nissan Sunnys, Novas, that sort of thing. They were all a big influence in my love for cars. </p> 

		<img  style="width:100%;  " src="../../images/user_cars/becca_civic/large/13.jpg">

       <p>I started off with my first car being a Glanza S, non turbo. I knew as my first car, I wanted something small and Jap. It was fine, a little rough around the edges, but I bought it standard and the obsession of modding cars begun. Simple changes, like OEM front and back lips, changed the wheels, recaros seats, lowering springs, de-catted exhaust to make it my own. Trying to do most of it myself, with help of course, it was definitely a car that introduced me to the ins and outs of cars. 
Then I moved onto a Honda Civic coupe ILS. I fell in love with this car, it was Milano Red and had gold BBS on it when I bought it. Again wanting to make it my own I changed the wheels a few times, from Rotas slips to Advans. I then decided to get an EG9 spoiler put on the boot for something different. Next thing I knew the whole car was getting a full respray. It was perfect, a clean straight car until one day my other half was getting it ready for NCT and discovered very bad rust in the back arches that were beyond repairable for me a that time. I cut my loses and scraped the car I adored. I physically cried that day. I had no car for a few weeks, and feeling heartbroken, I was on Donedeal looking at Hondas, depressing myself. and I scrolled across to see a bright yellow, slammed  ek4 looking at me, not knowing at the time it was a Jordan, I scrolled through the add and quickly got out of it thinking "ya I wish,some day..."  before I knew it i was on my way to view the car, and a few hours later the little beauty was mine!!! </p>

	<img  style="width:100%;  " src="../../images/user_cars/becca_civic/large/4.jpg">

	<p> To be honest it was the colour that stood out to me first, the Y56 sunlight yellow. It was only after realizing how special the history of it was. It is number 44 out of 500 every made. It's hard to do a check on how many are actually left but roughly in around 150, mostly spread out over Ireland and England. So you can say they are getting very rare now. I think its the reason I restored it and put the effort into it, if it was a normal ek4 I probably would have lost interest and sold it by now. 
 I decided, about two years ago, that it needed work and for that it needed to be declared off the road and start saving. Unfortunately I am only a beauty therapist with an average paying job so this took awhile. Once I had the funds together, the days of pay-palling and signing my name for parcels nearly everyday had began. Luckily enough, parts are easy enough to get for Hondas and won't break your bank like other cars would. Everything was slow but gradual, it definitely didn't happen over night. My car was stripped back basically to nothing and worked from the ground up, from new drop links to fully under-sealed to new gearbox bolts, it got everything new. It was hard to see it stripped back, feeling sorry for itself but I knew it would be worth it in the end. </p>

<p>To make it my own, I've put on a few carbons bits on it, such as a carbon Type-R spoiler, carbon grill, carbon mirrors and it came with a carbon bonnet. I've changed the wheels, added some winglets and  canards and lowered her on coilovers and obviously the full restoration and respray aswel. The inside it has mostly EK9 interior, red carpet and mats, EK9 back seats and red Recaros. The only original Jordan interior I have in it are the doorcards and the centre console that has the Eddie Jordan plaque on it, I personally wouldn't be a fan of the original Jordan interiors myself, also have a pink NRG steering wheel and purple K-tuned shifter with a full length broadway mirror for that girly touch, my boyfriend loves getting spotted if he drives with the pink steering wheel.   </p>

    <p>I don't mind being a girl in a guy dominated scene, to be honest I have more guy friends then I do girl friends so it dosent bother me. Girls are becoming way more popular in the car scene which is great, you're beginning to see more and more girls driving class cars. It can be hard sometimes because of comments that pass but sure that's life and haters gonna hate, 9/10 its jealously that a girl is driving a better car then them, but in  general I find cars a great social event, because no matter what car you have, if you have multicoloured hair or if your 10 foot tall everybody gets together and is there to talk about one thing every male or female has in common... cars! 


I find it funny when I'm driving along and there's a group of girls walking along the footpath and, they hear the exhaust, so they turn around and give the hair flick and the stare at the car just to realize its a girl driving. The look on their face is priceless.</p>
