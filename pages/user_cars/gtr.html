    <h1>Nissan GT-R Black Edition</h1>

    <img class="main_img" src="../../images/user_cars/gtr/large/53.jpg" alt="Nissan GTR on mountain roads">
      <p class="gtr_text">In 2001, Nissan unveiled the first concept of what it was to be called the "Nissan GT-R". This futuristic looking car was what, by Nissan standards, how a 21st century car should like. In 2005, they unveiled the GT-R Proto, the car that was very similar to the actual production vehicle. </p>
       <p class="gtr_text">December 2007 came, and the car was officially launched in Japan to be followed, seven months later, by  the US launch. In Europe, it only arrived in 2009 and since then it became a legend. With the GT-R, Nissan took the world by storm. All of the sudden, there was a car that could compete with supercars but at a fraction of the price, a car that would have enough room for 4 people, but still handle like a true race car. </p>
     <img class="main_img" src="../../images/user_cars/gtr/large/36.jpg" alt="Nissan GTR- country side road">

      <p class="gtr_text">Now, 10 years later after the first GT-R first showed up, the car already became a legend. From boy-racers to hard core track days maniacs, we all know what a GT-R is and there isn't one single person out there that can honestly say that he or she doesn't want one, honestly. One could say that, but nobody would believe it. The potent, highly modifiable engine, the versatility of this car turned into the weapon of choice for drag racers. Back in 2007, the international drag-race scene was dominated by Skylines, Supras, Laborghinis and the all familiar muscle cars. There were some able to do a quarter mile in just over 6 seconds, while the new kid on the block, the GT-R was already close to be a "tien seconds car" even standard.</p>
      <p class="gtr_text">Naturally, people started modifying them and now, 10 years later, we hear about 2000+ GT-R smashing it on the track constantly improving and breaking records. But this car can do so much more than go crazy fast in a straight line. It proved itself on the track too. But maybe above all, and this is the part that people don't mention much, the car is 100% able to be a daily driver.</p>
     <img class="main_img" src="../../images/user_cars/gtr/large/31.jpg" alt="Nissan GT-R coast road">
      <p class="gtr_text">Sure, it looks big, it looks heavy, it's not a roadster and it has, arguably, too much power. But there is nothing wrong with power, the car looks big due to it's shape while it isn't that heavy. It can tackle even back country roads without the slightest problem, sure, it won't feel like a small roadster, but you would rather be driving this than a big limousine, it does feel better and it even fits on Irish country roads. The suspension is able to cope with the rough road surface without hurting your kidneys, and the exhaust is quiet enough, at low RPM, not to scare your neighbors when you get home after a long drive.</p>
      <p class="gtr_text">As soon as you step inside, you know you are in a car meant to go fast, but make no mistake, Nissan didn't cheap out too much. The seats are still comfortable and there is plenty of room inside even for a taller driver. You want to take your kids to school? No problem, plenty of room in the back too!</p>
      <img class="main_img" src="../../images/user_cars/gtr/large/58.jpg" alt="interior">  

        
	<p class="gtr_text">The only thing we could find wrong with this car, is the price tag. Not even the price tag, because the older models aren't that prohibitive anymore, but the Irish government does not want us to drive these kind of cars, it's a shame really because they would collect way more money from the VAT paid at the petrol stations. So if you are thinking of buying one, keep in mind that the VRT for it would be around 20k. Some might say it's not worth it, but James, the owner of this monster, thinks otherwise.</p>	
	<p class="gtr_text">As a biker for a long time, he's used to having power, so it was only natural that his car would be a fast one. James is a man of few words, but we did manage to snatch a few from him:</p>

	<blockquote> I've wanted a gtr since launch back in 08 and it's been a long wait until I could afford one. It's a great car to drive it puts a smile on my face every time. I like the burble of the v6 even at low speeds, it's the nicest thing about it , also the car feels so solid. 
	I saw this car on pistonheads ,got in contact with the guy but he didn't really want to part with it , after about 3 months I finally got him to change his mind and the car was mine ,drove it down from Ballina, C.o Mayo ,one of the nicest spins I have ever had. 
     I would like to go abroad in it at some stage and maybe a couple of laps of the Nurburgring. I'll keep it stock ,maybe a few nice carbon parts but low key pieces.  
     </blockquote>
         
      <img class="main_img" src="../../images/user_cars/gtr/large/41.jpg" alt="GTR at sunset"> 

      <p class="gtr_text"> There is no point in talking about how fast this car is, or how it is a descendent of the Skyline, not while it was covered by every automotive magazine on the planet. We all know the specs, but not everybody talks about what we just did. In a country like Ireland, with high taxes and high insurance costs, James is the proof that the car enthusiast can not be stopped, no matter the hardships, or the strange regulations, we'll keep pushing on to keep this wonderful disease alive. </p>
