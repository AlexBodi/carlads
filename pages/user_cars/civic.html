			<h1>1991 Honda Civic EF3 GL</h1>

			

           <img  style="width:100%; " src="../../images/user_cars/civic/large/6.jpg">
        <h2>Loved and hated in the same time </h2>   
				<p>Back in 1972, Honda released what became one of the most controversial machine ever made, it was a car that some people would love it to bits while other would hate it with a passion. 
         Just like any other inexpensive car that could outperform other, more powerful and more expensive ones, the Civic became highly popular with young guys. They would get the older models next to nothing, modify and race them, this giving the Civic, and their owners, not the best reputation. But people are people and, in fact, loads of Civic owners are mature enough to know better, and care for these cars.</p> 

        <p>The Honda Civic was meant to be a small, inexpensive, reliable and cheap to run car, it's only purpose being to take you from point A to point B as cheap as possible. But everything changed in the 80s. In 1984 Honda released the Si model, that was powered by a 1.6l engine, with an output of 130hp. This was the turning point for the Civic, it was the moment when, the small car that saved the company back in the 70s, became the weapon of choice for a lot or car enthusiasts. Due to it's power to weight ration and maneuverability, it was able to keep up with more powerful and more expensive cars. Later models saw an increase in size, but also power, while keeping the same traits: small engine that can rev. Only in 2015 Honda went in a different direction and adopted a turbocharged powerplant capable of over 300hp. </p>

        <h2>Padraig's Civic</h2>

        <p>Padraig is one of the few young guys that manage to surprise the older car enthusiasts, and his 1991 Civic represents everything that's good about the car scene here. Sure, the car isn't a 1000hp RWD drift monster, but not all people can afford that or are into that kind of things, some just want to own a piece of history and maintain it in top shape. And this one certainly is in top shape.</p>
        <p>Padraig was a Honda fan from a young age, due to the fact that one of his cousins was a Honda guy too. He owned 2 EJs before, but always enjoyed the looks of the earlier model, the "box shape". He found this one in a shed, at his mechanic while paying a visit regarding another car (that might also be featured here, at some point). It took about 6 months until he had enough money to buy it, but it was finally his. A good condition, 52k miles, brown book Honda Civic... AUTOMATIC!</p>

        <p>The car needed some work, but nothing Padraig couldn't handle with the help of his friends. First thing he did was replace that horrendous automatic gearbox. He knew that this type of car shouldn't be driven with an automatic. The stance was modified, lower but not too low. Some tidying up followed with a couple of bits and pieces replaced and it was finally time to get it on the road.</p>

        <p>It's nice to see that younger generations do have the sense and mentality the older ones do, it's good to know that there will always be some people </p>
