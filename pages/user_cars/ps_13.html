		<h1> Nissan in Honda clothing </h1>

		<p>It was a cloudy day of January, a Sunday to be exact. The temperature was low and a light, yet persistent, drizzle was making you just curl up in bed and stay indoors.
		What else can you do on a cold and damp Sunday afternoon that stay in front of the TV, with a hot beverage and enjoy your favorite programs? You could always go outside to 
		play around with a 1991 Nissan PS13.</p>
		<img src="../../images/user_cars/red_ps13/clouds.jpg">
		<p> Thomas, who owns this gem of a car, a long time Japanese cars enthusiast, told us that he always loved this model even though he, at one point, owned a JZX100 Chaser. He sold this Chase and figured it was about time to get his hands on a PS13. A long and adventurous search began, finding a good condition, unabused PS13 is no easy task. </p>
		<p> Months have passed and "the right one" still didn't turn up, so Thomas started to look for one it Japan, thinking that there is no better source for a Japanese car. Turned out, after weeks of watching online auctions, that there were not one, but 3 PS13s, straight from Japan, just sitting in a shed not more than 12 miles from his place. A phone call and a 12 miles drive later, there she was! A nice, clean, rust free PS13 just waiting for it's new owner.</p>

		<img src="../../images/user_cars/red_ps13/rear.jpg">
		<p> The car was in good overall shape, but there was rooms for improvements, so Thomas decided it needed  a new paint and some modifications. Most of the work was done by Thomas and his father, who's a panel beater/spray painter by trade, they fitted new bumpers and skirts, new boot spoiler, all around lights and a new set of rims to complete the overall look that he was going for. The paint, and this is a bit controversial for all Nissan guys, is borrowed from Honda. Thomas is saying that there is no better "red" out there than the Milano Red by Honda. </p>
		<img src="../../images/user_cars/red_ps13/side.jpg">
		<p>He did not forget about mechanical work either, the PS13 also receiving a complete service with new air induction kit, a nice front mount intercooler and a set of coilovers to reach the stance he desired. All this work was done within 2 months, the car going into storage over the winter, but Thomas tells us that he has more plans concerning the car's interior and, naturally, engine mods. </p>

		<p>We will keep you posted!</p>
