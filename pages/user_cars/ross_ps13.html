			<h1>1992 Nissan PS13</h1>

			

          
         
				<p> Nissan is one of those car manufacturers that are best known for the fast cars they built and the Silvia, with it's several iterations, is  the "weapon of choice" for a lot of drifters and car enthusiasts.  The SIlvia first saw the light of day all the way back in 1964.
Also known as the Datsun 1500/1600, they were not built in great numbers and each of them was unique in it's own way, since all their body panels were hand crafted. Right now, they are a rare, a very rare sight and cost some serious money too. But for us, regular folks, the most notable was the S13, PS13, S14 and S15.
                         The S13, compared to it's younger brothers, was relatively cheap a few years back and they became very popular. Not only because of the price, but the turbo powerplant was easy enough to modify and, thanks to being a RWD, it quickly became a star in the newest, fastest growing motorsport in the world. A few years ago, the S13 was an all posters drift related, it was THE drift car. It was featured in almost all racing video games and, naturally, even people that weren't too interested in them at the time, became instant fans.</p>

        <p>  But this story is about a PS13. It's owner, Ross, is the kind of person with love for all things with wheels, but with a soft spot for this turbo sports car. He started out on his road as a petrolhead with a few field cars and his first project a 1.4SR Nova. After three more Opel's, he moved on (like most of us did) to Honda Civics, back in the Fast and Furious days. His one was a Coupe that got an engine swap for more power, big kits and a boot full of speakers. Fast and Furious era, so don't judge!
                    First Nissan was bought soon after, a white PS13 that didn't really "speak" much to Ross. Even though it was pretty well spec'd, it was sold after just 3 months in order to relieve the pressure put on his bank account by building a house WHILE owning an S-chassis. But the house was eventually built, and it was time for another project,
some of us just don't feel right without a project car eating up all our time and money. This time it was an EF9 SiR, and Ross is saying about it:
            "I obsessed over the thing to the point where I didn't want to drive it incase it got scratched, bumped, dented, wet or even looked at. Kind of pointless considering it was a great car to drive." </p>

        <p>   Clearly, Ross needed a car that could be driven without being too worried about it, so a Kouki 180SX was bought. But this car just planted the seed for another PS13. He kept comparing it with his old one which he now regretted selling. Eventually, the 180 was sold and the EF9 was back on the road. But something was amiss, it was just not the same, so yet another long search started, this time for a JZX81. But there's just something about the PS13, at this time the car kept popping up at each auction, maybe a sign? <br>

                After a few months, tired of being outbid on cars, the Silvia turned up in North Cork, fresh import, not even VRTd yet.  </p>
        <img  style="width:100%; " src="../../images/user_cars/ross_ps13/large/14.jpg">
        <p>In his own words:</p>
        <blockquote>At first I was not into it at all. Too rough I thought. But the more I looked around it the more it grew on me. Well spec'd and surprisingly clean underneath despite its cracked aero and no seats. <br>

I though f-it , it will be a bit of craic on the road at least.<br>

And man was I right. To be able to sit into something with a really good chassis set up, and not have to worry about scratching it, or worse sticking it into a ditch. A car you could sit into and DRIVE. <br>

And for any petrolhead that's what it's all about. Not having a really clean polished example sitting in a garage.<br><br>

So after a few months of happy ownership the decision was made and the EF was sold to a good buddy of mine, who has brought it to the next level. 

The cash injection helped get a few more bhp out of the Silvia with the help of Stiv at MTD tuning. <br>

A nice Garrett T28 71r , Nismo 555 injectors, tubular manifold , Walbro fuel pump and a few other bits helped her to see 347bhp, more than enough for my driving skills and loads for a road car. 

But again it just added to making it a blast to drive. <br><br>

I don't have any real plans set in stone but if I spot anything that will add to it with out taking from the look it always had, like the bride Zeta or old school Preyton steering wheel I'll have it. I really don't want to put anything on the 
car that it won't have had fitted by whoever pieced it together in Japan. I don't really want to take from its character by adding big 326 wings and sticking a set of "in at the minute " wheels on it.   

I just want to enjoy it for what it is, it's loud ,low ,stupid, in your face glory. </blockquote>
